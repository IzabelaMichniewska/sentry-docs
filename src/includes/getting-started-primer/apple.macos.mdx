**Features:**

- Multiple types of errors are captured, including:
  - Mach exceptions
  - Fatal signals
  - Unhandled exceptions
  - C++ exceptions
  - Objective-C exceptions
  - Main thread deadlock (experimental)
- Events [enriched](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for
  - Application lifecycle events (`didBecomeActive`, `didEnterBackground`)
  - Touch events
  - System events (battery level or state changed, memory warnings, device orientation changed, keyboard did show and did hide, screenshot taken)
  - Outgoing HTTP requests
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Attachments](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files
- [User Feedback](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs

**Features using Swizzling:**

The Cocoa SDK uses [swizzling](https://nshipster.com/method-swizzling/) to provide some features out of the box without boilerplate code. The following features use swizzling:

- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/">Breadcrumbs for touch events</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#http-instrumentation">Auto instrumentation for HTTP requests</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/performance/connect-services/">Automatically added sentry-trace header to HTTP requests for distributed tracing</PlatformLink>

Since Cocoa <= 7.5.0, you can opt out of swizzling using options. When disabling swizzling, the SDK disables the features above:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableSwizzling = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableSwizzling = NO;
}];
```
