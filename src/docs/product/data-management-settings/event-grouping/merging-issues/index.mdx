If you have similar-looking issues that have not been grouped automatically, you can tell Sentry that you want these types of issues to be goruped going forward by merging them.

This is for merging similar issues and will not auto-merge the next occurrence of this issue coming in.
<!-- what exactly what does the statement above mean?-->
<!-- TO DO add screenshots that actually show this in an easy-to-see way. right now the screenshots don't really clarify much of anything-->

Before merge there are two issues that are very similiar, but have not been grouped together.

After, testTypeIssue7 and testTypeIssue8 are merged into one issue.

You can also do this from inside a single issue. Click the "Similar Issues" tab, select all of the issues that you want to merge, and click "Merge".

<Alert level="info">

Future issues will be added to the merged set only if they match one of the stack traces in the merged set.
