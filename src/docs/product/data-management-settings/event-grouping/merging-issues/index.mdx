If you have similar-looking issues that have not been grouped automatically, you can tell Sentry that you want these types of issues to be grouped going forward by merging them.

This is for merging similar issues and will not auto-merge the next occurrence of this issue coming in.
<!-- what exactly what does the statement above mean? Do we mean, this won't happen if the next event doesn't have the same stack trace? See note at end.-->

Before merge, there are two issues that are very similiar, but have not been grouped together. One issue has 39 events in the past 24 hours and the other has 76.

After, the two issues are are merged into one, and the event count of 115 reflects that they've been grouped.

You can also do this from inside a single issue. Click the "Similar Issues" tab, select all of the issues that you want to merge, and click "Merge".

<Alert level="info">

Future issues will be added to the merged set only if they match one of the stack traces in the merged set.
